    Here I will exhaust all there is to know about different relationships in a way that makes sense to me. I hope it is 
    of great help to you.
</p>
<p>
    As we take on our different paths in life just as God had designed in the beginning of time, we realise that
    we spend more time relating with other people than we spend on our own because no man is meant to be an island.
    We need eachother and that is why we ought to make the right decisions when choosing who to relate with and
    what our relationships should be about.<blockquote cite="https://www.thefashionspot.com/"><i>Making relationships our biggest 
    muse and inspiration</i></blockquote>
</p>
</section>
<p>This means to tell us:<q>Relationships are essential in our day to day lives.</q></p>
<article>
<p>
    For those that believe that man can be on his own, I would love to challenge you to giving relationships another chance but this
    time in a proper way without excepting the same attitude from others in return and in this way people will start to emulate the way you make relationships 
    with other people and at the end of the day it will be worth it.

<p><i>Changing the world one at a time</i></p>
<p> 
    You may have your own reasons as to why you chose that line of thought but even when God created Adam, 
    He said that it wasn't good for man to be alone and therafter He decided to create him a helper, Eve, who was a woman. Now this was not because Adam had pleaded, 
    but because the all knowing God knew that he needed one. So who are we to say that we can walk the journey of life in solitude.
</p>
        
    I for one believe that we are all pieces of a whole puzzle. Therefore, each one of us has a specific role we are supposed to play in this life to make life easier or better for the other person. In other words God created you for a specific purpose and He put you on this earth to ensure that you fulfill it in a given time range.

<p>
    Many people walk through this life and leave it without fulfilling their God given purpose for on e reason or the 
    other. But I am positive that one of the reasons as to why it unfolded in that manner is that they had a mindset of solitude 
    and they chose to keep many of their ideas to themselves. This did not do any good to those that remained here after 
    they had left because someone that was meant to create a teleportation machine left some behind some unfinished business, something 
    that would lead to a major break through in a certain project thus delaying the process it would take to finally break 
    another world record.
